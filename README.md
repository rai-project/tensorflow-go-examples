# TensorFlow Go Examples

This repo contains end-to-end examples of model inference using TensorFlow Go API. More are coming.
Contributions with similar simple examples (or by further improving existing examples) are highly welcome. Please file a pull request or an issue on GitHub, or contact me at <cli99@illinois.edu>.

## Models
